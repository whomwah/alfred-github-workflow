# An Alfred 5 Workflow for Github

Written in TypeScript and running via Deno.

## Introduction

As usual with these sort of projects, is basically scratching in itch. I have been following [Deno](https://deno.land/) since it's conception and and a fan of everything it's doing right now. I don't get to use it a lot in my day to day development (although I really think this is going to change soon) so wanted a side project to give me the opportunity to not only use it but to be big enough that I could "keep up" with latest Deno changes. The best way of learning for me has always been doing.

I'm a long time user of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and it's probaly the most uses bit of software on my machine. I'm not actually sure what I would do without it so ingrained in my daily rouinte that it is.

One of the workflows I use daily is https://github.com/gharlan/alfred-github-workflow. It's indispencable for me. It's also a great example of a Alfred workflow with some interesting development features like using [SQlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as a cache.

It's written in PHP, which is not a problem but not a language I personally develop in so I'm not able to contribute to the project or extend it. Trying to create a new verison in TypeScript should be interesting.

NOTE: It's very much work in progress right now.
